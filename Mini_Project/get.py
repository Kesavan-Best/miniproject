He presented with fluctuating blood sugar levels for the past two weeks, complaining of dizziness, frequent urination, and mild blurry vision. Physical examination showed mild dehydration and slight weight loss. Initial blood sugar reading upon admission was 295 mg/dL, and HbA1c test indicated poor long-term glucose control. IV fluids were started to correct dehydration, and a basal-bolus insulin regimen was initiated with regular monitoring. Nursing staff were instructed to check blood sugar every four hours. A nutrition consult was requested to evaluate dietary habits, as the patient admitted occasional noncompliance with medication. Foot examination revealed early neuropathic changes, and education on foot care and ulcer prevention was provided. No signs of infection or gangrene were noted. An ophthalmology consult was planned to evaluate diabetic retinopathy. Blood pressure and lipid profile were checked for comorbidities. Past surgical history includes appendectomy in 2005, and family history is positive for hypertension and diabetes. He lives with his family and has moderate social support. A psychological evaluation was requested to address medication fatigue, and the endocrinology team was consulted for insulin dose adjustment. His dietary plan was modified to include low-glycemic meals, and he was counseled on the importance of regular exercise. Overnight glucose monitoring continued to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia, though none were observed. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones with no infection detected. Liver and kidney function tests were within normal limits. He received education on recognizing hypo- and hyperglycemia symptoms, and his insulin injection technique was reviewed and corrected. A social worker discussed options for long-term diabetes education programs. He remained hemodynamically stable during his stay. Cardiovascular risk assessment was initiated due to comorbid risks. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute changes. Nursing documentation was reviewed for completeness and accuracy, and vital signs were monitored every four hours, all within acceptable ranges. His case was discussed during multidisciplinary team rounds, and discharge planning started, contingent upon glucose stabilization. He expressed motivation to adhere to his treatment plan. Educational booklets on diabetes were provided and reviewed. His caregiver was instructed on signs of hypoglycemia and emergency response. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with endocrinology and nutrition. Vaccination status was reviewed, and a flu shot was recommended. Regular eye and foot examinations were stressed for future visits, with emphasis on consistent medication timing and dietary adherence. Lab results were shared with the patient to improve self-awareness. Night nurse reported stable vitals and no acute events overnight. Morning sugar level showed improvement after insulin adjustment. IV fluids were planned to be tapered as oral intake improved, and daily weight measurements were initiated to monitor fluid balance. Communication was maintained between nursing and medical teams. Education was reinforced regarding complications of uncontrolled diabetes. The patient was encouraged to keep a personal glucose log. Discharge was anticipated in 2â€“3 days if stabilization continued. All consultations were completed, and final dietitian recommendations were awaited. Medication list was reviewed and updated for discharge planning. Emergency contact details were confirmed with the patient and caregiver. He verbalized understanding of discharge instructions. Final insulin dose titration was planned for the following morning. Overall progress was satisfactory, and the patient responded well to interventions. The plan for discharge or further management depended on the progress of Diabetes.'),
